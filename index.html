        <p>Hello everyone! Not sure if this is a picture of my city but I truly loved this image and how it is set in
            the evening showing all the beautiful lights of the city and the snowy mountain tops. Northern Utah is know
            for its snow and we have so many fun things to do in the winter months such as skiing and snowboarding. </p>
